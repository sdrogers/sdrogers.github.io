I've been meaning for ages to try and write some more, and so this is where that writing is going to live. Only time will tell how much I actually end up posting here. I think it'll mostly be about AI, but who knows - I like other stuff too.

About me: I work in data, for NHS Scotland (normal disclaimer -- all views on this site are my own). I was appointed to work in Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning but I also work on more traditional data warehousing projects (without good data, there will be no AI). I've been at NHS Scotland since April 2021 and before that I spent >10 years as an academic in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow where I did a lot of teaching, a lot of admin, and a fair amount of research. I also wrote [this textbook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Course-Machine-Learning-Pattern-Recognition/dp/1498738486).
